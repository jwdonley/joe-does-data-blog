Howdy!

My name is Joe, and I've worked in the web software industry for over eleven years. And, it is time to shake things up.

A few weeks ago I came across the new Google Data Analysis Certificate program on Coursera. It looked interesting, and I saw Data Analysis as a new possibility to shake up my career.

Then I found Data Engineering. This seems even more interesting since it would also apply my previous years of experience in software development.

I've started the Google Certification already, and I'm about half way through. A lot of it is stuff I already know.
I'm also doing a quick refresher course on Python. I'd forgotten how much fun Python can be, and look forward to using it more and more in this exciting new field.

I figured it would be good to have a place on the web to document this journey into the world of Data. Here I will post updates on what I've learned as well as portfolio projects and other interesting things I find related to Data Analyis, Data Engineering, and Data Science.

For this I am using Hugo, a static site generator, and hosting the site at Firebase. This will let me work on my Git chops and learn more about application hosting options.

So, be sure to follow along and feel free to learn along with me.


Thanks for stopping by,

Joe
